# Hi there

Since you're on this page at all, and also decided to read about the author, hello!

My name is Mat. I like to make things and solve problems.
Here are a few things in life that are important to me:

## Tech

I'm always on my computer, for better or worse.
As time marches on, I think a lot of us are using software very frequently -
to engage with social media,
to manage knowledge,
to operate businesses,
to create digital experiences or capture memories -
and it's interesting to me to think about how it works, how well it works,
and how much of it is built on these huge abstractions.

These are the things I'm currently learning:

- React Native development with Expo

## Music

Music is an interesting and important hobby to me.
In school from a young age, I was very involved in group music-making;
school jazz and concert bands, youth orchestras and pit orchestras for school musicals.

At university, I developed an interest in electronic music.
I noticed the freedom making music with software allowed one person: to design and compose sounds and instruments into entire songs.
A friend showed me FruityLoops Studio (though I eventually ended up on Ableton and have been loyal since), and I knew from there I was going to fall in love with music production.
It's always a dopamine hit whether or not I have a finished song by the end of a production session.

## Cooking

Cooking lets me make things with my hands!
But really, it's about processing materials with technique and creativity.
I have my mom to thank for helping me on my culinary journey from a young age,
and food has been a staple part of tradition on my Japanese family side.

I tend to be a harsh critic with my cooking, but I know I make the best french fries I've ever had, and I've had **a lot** of french fries.

## Climbing

I love climbing. Especially **bouldering**.
It's an awesome way to use your brain and body to tackle complex problems.
Rope climbing is great too, and tends to test your cardiovascular and
muscular fitness in a way that exposes those things for what they are.
You can't escape getting tired on the wall if you're not in shape!

Currently, I'm working to send every 5.12a on toprope and V5 on boulder.
I'm also making an app to help track my bouldering journey!
