I want to contribute to meaningful projects at a company I care about. I have 5 YOE
working cross-functionally on teams, 2 YOE leading a team of technical solutions, 1 YOE working
officially as a software engineer. I enjoy fun and intuitive interaction and UI design, 
thinking about how to integrate front-end and back-end, and learning new technologies 
and strategies to achieve these goals.
